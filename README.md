## **Model Comparison and Analysis
This repository contains data and visualizations comparing various AI models, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Meta AI. The analysis focuses on usage frequency, retention rates, churn rates, A/B testing results, and other performance metrics.

Project Overview
This project uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the performance metrics of different AI models. It provides insights into:

Usage frequency and satisfaction scores.
Retention and churn rates for each model.
A/B testing results and performance improvements over time.
Key feedback topics and recommended improvements.

# **Features
Bar Plot: Usage frequency visualization.
Pie Charts: Retention and churn rates for AI models.
Line Plot: A/B testing performance comparison over time.
Data Insights:
Primary use cases and customer behavior.
Feedback-driven roadmap impact reports.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.
NumPy: Supporting numerical computations.
